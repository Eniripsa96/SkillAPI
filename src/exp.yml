# Experience yields for anything except combat. Combat experience is either controlled
# via vanilla experience dropped or the yields defined in config.yml.

# These are experience values provided when a player breaks a block.
break:
  #
  # Whether or not to allow players to place a block back down and break it again
  # to get additional experience. Note that disabling this will cause all block
  # changes to be tracked in order to remember what was placed or not. Blocks
  # existing before this is disabled will not be protected from experience yields.

  # The yields per block type. You can add any block types not in this list by simply
  # appending the bukkit name of the block type. See
  # https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
  # for valid types. This list is not case-sensitive.
  types:
    #
    # You can add classes as well that allow certain blocks only to benefit
    # that class. For example, if you want a miner to benefit from ore but
    # a farmer to benefit from crops, you can add a "miner" section containing
    # the ore and a "farmer" section containing the crops. This would look something
    # like:
    #
    # # Blocks only for miners
    # miner:
    #   COAL: 1
    #   IRON_ORE: 10
    # # Blocks only for farmers
    # farmer:
    #   CROPS: 5

# Experience yields when a player places a block. There's not a built-in way to check
# for players repeatedly placing down the same block, so use this type of experience
# with caution. Works similar to break, just without the replace option.
